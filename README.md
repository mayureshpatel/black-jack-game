# Black-Jack-Game
A simple black jack to be played in the console. Tried to go the object oriented way in creating the game by using a bottom-up approach.
For example, the project started with creating just a card object and then having various types of cards. The idea was to be able to
create several playing-card based games. Black Jack will be the first, and will try to make other games.

I'm not that well versed in making a GUI and making a graphical game for this but will eventually venture out into that. Currently, I
am just putting together various concepts.
